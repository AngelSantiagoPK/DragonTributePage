          <p>
            <span>D</span>ragon Ball Z is a Japanese anime television series
            produced by Toei Animation. Part of the Dragon Ball media franchise,
            it is the sequel to the 1986 Dragon Ball anime series and adapts the
            latter 325 chapters of the original Dragon Ball manga series created
            by Akira Toriyama. The series aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April
            1989 to January 1996 and was later dubbed for broadcast in at least
            81 countries worldwide. Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of
            Goku in his adult life as he and his companions defend the Earth
            against villains including aliens (Vegeta, Frieza), androids (Cell),
            and magical creatures (Majin Buu). At the same time, the story
            parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of
            his rivals, Piccolo and Vegeta. Due to the success of the anime in
            the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were
            initially released by Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title. The
            anime's popularity has also spawned numerous media and merchandise
            that has come to represent the majority of content within the Dragon
            Ball franchise. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural icon through
            numerous adaptations and re-releases, including a remastered
            broadcast titled Dragon Ball Z Kai.

              <p>
                Originally sent to Earth by his parents as an infant, Kakarot
                was adopted by Grandpa Gohan and renamed Son Goku. A head injury
                at an early age altered Goku's memory, ridding him of his
                initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become
                one of Earth's greatest defenders. Goku constantly strives and
                trains to be the greatest warrior possible, which has kept the
                Earth and the universe safe from destruction multiple times.

                Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a
                ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer, but later
                abandoned his position in the Frieza Force for a peaceful life
                on Earth. He would repeatedly fight alongside Universe 7's most
                powerful warriors in order to protect Earth and his family, as
                well as to surpass Goku in power.

              <p>
                After inheriting Cold's imperialist army and rising to power as
                the emperor of Universe 7 at a young age, Frieza quickly
                established himself as a ruthless tyrant, feared across the
                universe for his unparalleled cruelty and power. Ever since his
                invasion of Namek, Frieza has been the series' most recurring
                villain, clashing with his archnemesis Goku and his allies on
                several occasions, becoming even more powerful every time.

              <h3 class="justify-right">Broly</h3>
              <p>
                Broly was born in Age 737, during the period of intense turmoil
                between Frieza and the Saiyans. At birth, his most curious
                feature was his inordinate power level of 10,000. This anomaly
                meant that by birth, Broly's power had already been close to
                that of Bardock and King Vegeta at the time of their deaths. In
                the Saiyan delivery room where he rests afterward, Broly is
                tormented by the constant crying of his neighbor, Kakarot.
                Kakarot's crying, combined with the traumatic events to follow,
                affected Broly's psychological state of mind, causing him to
                hold a subconscious grudge against him. The two infants would
                not meet again for almost three decades.
