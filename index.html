            <span>D</span>ragon Ball Z is a Japanese anime television series
            produced by Toei Animation. Part of the Dragon Ball media franchise,
            it is the sequel to the 1986 Dragon Ball anime series and adapts the
            latter 325 chapters of the original Dragon Ball manga series created
            by Akira Toriyama. The series aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April
            1989 to January 1996 and was later dubbed for broadcast in at least
            81 countries worldwide. Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of
            Goku in his adult life as he and his companions defend the Earth
            against villains including aliens (Vegeta, Frieza), androids (Cell),
            and magical creatures (Majin Buu). At the same time, the story
            parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of
            his rivals, Piccolo and Vegeta. Due to the success of the anime in
            the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were
            initially released by Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title. The
            anime's popularity has also spawned numerous media and merchandise
            that has come to represent the majority of content within the Dragon
            Ball franchise. Dragon Ball Z remains a cultural icon through
            numerous adaptations and re-releases, including a remastered
            broadcast titled Dragon Ball Z Kai.
